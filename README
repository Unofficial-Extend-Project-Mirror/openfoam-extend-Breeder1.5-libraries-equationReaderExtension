Description
===========
An extension to OpenFOAM that allows you to read equations from a dictionary
file and (optionally) have them evaluated at every time step.  It is a user-
installed modification to OpenFOAM's core library.

Installation/Compilation
========================

equationReader must be installed into OpenFOAM's core library.  Since it is
still in beta, you have to do this manually.  You only have to edit one file.  To install equationReader:

0. If you are running precompiled binaries, first ensure that you can compile
   your copy of OpenFOAM.

1. Download the code from:

http://openfoam-extend.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openfoam-extend/trunk/Breeder_1.5/libraries/equationReaderExtension/?view=tar

2. Edit the src/OpenFOAM/Make/files file.

3. Around line 123 you will find "$(entry)/entryIO.C".  Add this after it:

equation = $(dictionary)/equation
$(equation)/equationReader/equationReader.C
$(equation)/equation/equation.C
$(equation)/equationOperation/equationOperation.C

4. Save and close the file.

5. Open a terminal window, and browse to the directory with your download.

6. Execute the following commands.  You should be able to copy and paste all 9
   lines into the terminal window.

tar --transform='s,equationReaderExtension,'$WM_PROJECT_DIR',' \
-x -v -z -P -f openfoam-extend-equationReaderExtension.tar.gz
cd $WM_PROJECT_DIR
rmdepall
wmake libso
cd $FOAM_APP/test/equationReader/equationReaderDemo
wmake
cd $FOAM_APP/test/equationReader/equationReaderTester
wmake

Contents
========

 - The source code for the library, which should end up in:
        src/OpenFOAM/db/dictionary/equation
 - A modified version of Scalar.C, which should end up in:
        src/OpenFOAM/primitives/Scalar
 - A demo application (equationReaderDemo) that demonstrates the basic use of
   equationReader.  After installation, this should end up in:
        applications/test/equationReader/equationReaderDemo
 - A test application (equationReaderTester) that puts the equationReader
   through a series of tests with an integrated solver.  This should end up in:
        applications/test/equationReader/equationReaderTester
 - Tutorial directories for both of these applications.  These should end up
   in:
        tutorials/equationReader/
